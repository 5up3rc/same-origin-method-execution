##Example
There is a directory included in this repository containing proof-of-concept code which showcases the vulnerability. To see the vulnerability, first add 'attacker.com' and 'victim.com' to point to your webserver in '/etc/hosts'. Then, navigate to 'main.html' where the exploit should run. If all works correctly, then there should be an alert pop-up on victim.com, displaying Javascript execution.
